# Object Detection (Computer Vision Course Project-2)

This project is about Object Detection, which involves extensive research about methods proposed around 2000's as well as latest methods such as those around 2017. This project mainly aims at reproducing the results obtained by two seminal papers (Viola-Jones and Focal Loss), and understanding a total of 4 different methods.
